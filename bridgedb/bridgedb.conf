# CHANGELOG:
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# Changed in version 0.3.3 - 2015-07-22

# Hashring Allocation Options   \
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These options determine the proportions of bridges per hashring. When
# BridgeDB receives a descriptor for a new bridge, that bridge is assigned to
# a hashring. For example, if ``HTTPS_DIST`` and ``EMAIL_DIST`` are both
# enabled, there is a hashring for bridges allocated to the HTTP(S)
# Distributor, and another for the Email Distributor. In addition, an
# "Unallocated" hashring is always created, in order to reserve some portion
# of bridges for manual distribution, or as backup in the case of a major
# blocking event. Once a bridge is assigned to one of these allocation groups,
# it stays there; there is currently no mechanism for changing a bridge's
# hashring allocation.
#
# Once a bridge is assigned to either of the first two groups, it stays there
# persistently. The bridges are allocated to these groups in a proportion of
#
#     ``MOAT_SHARE`` : ``HTTPS_SHARE`` : ``EMAIL_SHARE`` : ``RESERVED_SHARE``
